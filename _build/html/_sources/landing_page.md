# The Calibration Workflow Environment (DEMvironment)

This website documents a workflow environment, developed within the [Caliper project](https://caliper-itn.org/) for the calibration of discrete element models (DEM) that are used to simulate granular materials. Core parts of the workflow are developed within the [Orange3](https://orangedatamining.com/) python-based graphical data mining tool. 
The goal of the environment is to create an automated integration of experimental and simulation results and speed up the calibration process.

"DEMvironment" stands for: 	**DEM** workflow en**vironment** (for the Calibration of DEM parameters)
