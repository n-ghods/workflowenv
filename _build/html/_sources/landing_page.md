# The Calibration workflow environment

This a workflow environment, developed within the [Caliper project](https://caliper-itn.org/) for the calibration of the discrete element modelling (DEM) of granular material. The workflow is developed within the [Orange3](https://orangedatamining.com/) python-based graphical data mining tool, in order to create an automated integration of experimental and simulation results and speed up the calibration process.

# Acknowledgment

The Caliper project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska Curie grant agreement No. 812638.
