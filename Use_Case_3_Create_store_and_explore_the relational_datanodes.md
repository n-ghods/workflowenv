Creating, storing and exploring relational data-nodes in DB (from literature)
======================

Sub-System: python3 (workflow environment: i.e. orange3)

This use case describes how to create relational data-nodes (e.g. any empirical or theoretical equations reported in literature) in the database, store the data and metadata, explore committed relational data, and retrieve them.

| Use Case Name                       | Creating, storing and exploring relational data-nodes in DB  |
| Scope                               | Loading equations and related metadata in the database       |
| Level                               | Top-Level data submission                                    |
| Primary Actor                       | Researchers who wants to calibrate a DEM model (a master or Ph.D. students who has done literature review on useful relations which can be utilized in any calibration steps) |
| Stakeholders and Interests          | Researchers who explore the results of the DEM simulations or develop calibration workflows, or experimentalists who conduct tests for calibration of DEM models |
| Preconditions                       | The required metadata about the equation is available (e.g. the author(s), DOI of the article, the relational equation, etc.) |
| Success Guarantee                   | Accessing and committing data to the database is completed without error. Data-node is available in the database. |
| Main Success Scenario               | Meta data file is created successfully                       |
| Extensions                          | -                                                            |

| Technology and Data Variations List | -                                                            |
| Frequency of Occurrence             | Whenever an input from or comparison with literature data is necessary in the calibration process. |
| Miscellaneous                       | -                                                            |
