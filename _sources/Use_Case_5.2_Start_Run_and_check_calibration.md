======================

Sub-System:  LIGGGHTS (or Aspherix) - (distributed by DCS Computing GmbH) 

This use case describes how to start and run a successful calibration case.

| Use Case Name                       | Start, Run and Check the Calibration                         |
| Scope                               | Running a calibration workflow with the available information in the database |
| Level                               | High-level calibration                                       |
| Primary Actor                       | Researchers who wants to calibrate a DEM model, or analyse data of DEM simulations (A PhD student or Master student who has done DEM Simulations before) |
| Stakeholders and Interests          | Researchers who perform DEM simulations or develop DEM models, experimentalists who conduct tests for calibration of DEM models |
| Preconditions                       | The UC5.1 has been successfully completed.                   |
| Success Guarantee                   | Calibration tool signals successful completion.              |
| Main Success Scenario               | Start the calibration. Check for any error or warnings. Fix the errors or maybe revise UC5.1. Run the calibration locally or submit to a HPC (if this is the case, prepare the cluster information). The Aspherix calibration signals a successful convergence for all the target parameters. |
