======================

Sub-System:  LIGGGHTS (or Aspherix) - (distributed by DCS Computing GmbH) 

This use case describes how to prepare initial input for each calibration workflow.

| Use Case Name                       | Preparing input for each calibration workflow                |
| Scope                               | Preparation of all required input file to run a calibration case using Aspherix calibration tool |
| Level                               | High-level calibration data submission                       |
| Primary Actor                       | Researchers who wants to calibrate a DEM model, or analyse data of DEM simulations (A PhD or Master student who has done DEM Simulations before) |
| Stakeholders and Interests          | Researchers who perform DEM simulations or develop DEM models, experimentalists who conduct tests for calibration of DEM models |
| Preconditions                       | The user has already retrieved data that are required for calibration from the database (one or more experimental data set or correlation data, assuming all data that has been recorded is available -physical properties-). |
| Success Guarantee                   | All the input parameters required for the calibration are input to the files and are functional. |
| Main Success Scenario               | The user will search in the available templates. The user has copied the template file structure for the calibration. The retrieved data is input in the file structure for the calibration. The user modifies the .casx file required for Aspherix calibration. |
| file Extensions                     |                                                              |
| Special Requirements                | none                                                         |
| Technology and Data Variations List |                                                              |
| Frequency of Occurrence             | upon request in each calibration step                        |
| Miscellaneous                       | It should be functional for at least two sets of experiments. |
