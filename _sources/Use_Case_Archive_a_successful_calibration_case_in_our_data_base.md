How to archive a successful calibration case in our database
======================

Sub-System: Aspherix -or LIGGGHTS- (distributed by DCS Computing GmbH) and Orange3

This use case describes how to archive calibration data (incl. the metadata, simulation's input and calibrated parameters and response surfaces, the simulation output files, and the status/validity of the calibration)
