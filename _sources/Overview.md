# Overview

The workflow environment WORKFORCE has three core capabilities:

1. preparing input data and interacting with a database
2. performing calibration tasks of one or more parameters
3. storing and utilizing calibrated parameters for DEM simulations

Specifically, WORKFORCE consists of a set of individual "workforce" that are centered around a certain use case of the environment.

While WORKFORCE was build with ASPHERIX and LIGGGHTS as the main work horses, it can be easily equipped with adaptors for any other DEM simulation or calibration tool.

Describing how it works generally.
